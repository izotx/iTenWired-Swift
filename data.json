CIO's will discuss the issues that affect their organizations today and provide insight into the future of IT. It is an opportunity for IT professionals and technology service and infrastructure providers to hear a frank and open discussion about the future of the IT industry. We will have a panel of 3 to 5 CIO's guided by a moderator. CIO's from Military/training, Medical, manufacturing, banking, government, education, and technology have been invited. The moderator will present the panel with 3 or 4 CIO level issues/challenges. Each will have an opportunity to discuss his/her views on how his/her organization approaches the issues. The panel can exchange ideas/approaches with each other and attendees will hear the directions and concepts of the CIO's and better understand the types and extent of services that will be needed as the organizations mature and change to meet future IT challenges. This discussion is also a great opportunity for service providers and vendors to understand what skill sets, services, and technology are required. Given the current volatility in the economy this type of event offers the opportunity to understand where the market place is headed, how to prepare, and how to remain competitive.",
